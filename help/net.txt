Net

Rotate the grid squares so that they all join up into a single connected network with no loops.

Click in a square to rotate it anticlockwise. Long-press to rotate it clockwise.

Squares connected to the middle square are lit up. Aim to light up every square in the grid (not just the endpoint blobs).

When this gets too easy, select a 'wrapping' variant from the Type menu to enable grid lines to run off one edge of the playing area and come back on the opposite edge!
