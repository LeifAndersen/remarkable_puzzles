Cube

Roll the cube around the grid, picking up the shaded squares on its faces. Try to get all the shaded squares on to the object at the same time, in as few moves as possible.

Use the arrow keys to roll the cube, or click the mouse where you want it to roll towards. After every roll, the grid square and cube face that you brought into contact swap their colours, so that a non-shaded cube face can pick up a shaded square, but a shaded face rolled on to a non-shaded square puts it down again.

When you have mastered the cube, use the Type menu to select other regular solids!
