Unruly

Colour every square either black or white, in such a way that: 

- no three consecutive squares, horizontally or vertically, are the same colour 
- each row and column contains the same number of black and white squares.

Click in an empty square to turn it black, or long-press to turn it white. Click again in an already-filled square to cycle it between black and white and empty.
