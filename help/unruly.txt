Unruly

Colour every square either black or white, in such a way that: 

- no three consecutive squares, horizontally or vertically, are the same colour 
- each row and column contains the same number of black and white squares.

Left-click in an empty square to turn it black, or right-click to turn it white. Click again in an already-filled square to cycle it between black and white and empty; middle-click to reset any square to empty.
